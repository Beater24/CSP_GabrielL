        <p>When it comes to some people prefer to actually play sports others prefer to watch them
            And for those they prefer to watch they likely root for a professional team and there are 
            many reasons as to why people root for the team they root for. Also don't hover over the title.
        </p>
        <h2>Some reasons as to why people have a favorite team</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Many people root for a team because they live in the area the team is based
                in this adds local connection to the fan and the team.
            </li>
            <li>Many fans root for a team because of a player, alligning with locality
                they root for the team because one of the players from the team is from the country
                a fan is of that adds a step into eventually becoming a fan of a team.
            </li>
            <li>Some fans had an experience growing up alongside the team. Say they grew up in eras
                where the team they root for was good so they were exposed to the team very early on 
                wheather from TV or YouTube.
            </li>
            <li>This reason is considered unacceptable to most sports fans and its going on a bandwagon
                a term where someone goes from one team to another team because the previous team wasn't
                doing as good as they used to so they jumped in to another team that is good.
            </li>
