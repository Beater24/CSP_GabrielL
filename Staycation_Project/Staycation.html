        <p>Salt Lake City is a city in Utah, and its not only the capital but also the biggest city in the entire state with a population of 209,593 in a 2023 census. The City got its name from the giant lake nearby known as the Great Salt Lake.The SLC-Provo-Ogden area 
            is where the majority of Utah residents live. While Salt Lake City isn't a ginourmous city like New York City. Salt Lake City isn't just the city itself as there's many suburbs in its metro area as well as two outside counties (Utah and Tooele).
            There's many fun things to do around in the city especially downtown, one of the major attractions downtown is in the north with the Utah State Capitol, a ginourmous building with a dome at the top along with many governmental buildings beside.
            A few blocks south you find Temple Square which is going through a renovation but it contains a lot of monuments and buildings often refered to as temples, one iconic building is the Tabernacle but one of my favorites is the Joeseph Smith Memorial 
            Building because of its castlelike exterior. Across from North Temple street you find the Conference center, which is a really big theather. A couple blocks down is mostly entertainment space containing spots like the City Creek Center which is a mall 
            that has outdoor and indoor sections. To the west of that you will find The Salt Palace Convention Center a space where major conventions come to the city. Yet again to the West of that is the Delta Center home of two pro sports teams the Utah Jazz of the NBA and 
            the Utah Hockey Club of the NHL. It also hosts concerts and other major events that come to Salt Lake City. Yet again to the west of that you have The Gateway which is a little different than a outlet mall but also contains multiple amenities like museums
            and arcades and even has a plaza in the middle of it. There are many hotels nearby that area since it will be a tourist attraction. To the east of downtown near the mountains is the main campus of the University of Utah which has all of the academic buildings, fields and stadiums,
            along with museums and reasarch centers in its area. To the very west near the lake will likely be your starting point in the city, the Salt Lake City International Airport which has many people flying from other parts of not just the U.S. but the world. 
            It's one of the biggest airports when it comes to land area. Additionaly people could go into the streets and try the unique restaurants in Salt Lake City. Additionally this is outside of SLC's city boundries but there's a small town called Park City about 
            40 minutes away from downtown SLC this place is useful for going skiing or snowboarding in the winter but make sure to bring your coats since it is very cold in there. There are plenty of attractions such as the Loveland Aquarium outside of the city boundries 
            but these small suburbs are still counted in the SLC Metro Area. This place is overall a good place to visit because its different from most landmarks in the southern
            side of the state.
