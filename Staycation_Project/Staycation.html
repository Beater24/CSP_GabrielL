        <h1>Salt Lake City</h1>
        <p>Salt Lake City is a city in Utah, and its not only the capital but also the biggest city in the entire state with a population of 209,593 in a 2023 census. The SLC-Provo-Ogden area is where the majority of Utah residents live. While Salt Lake City isn't a ginourmous city like New York City 
            There's many fun things to do around in the city especially downtown, one of the major attractions downtown is in the north with the Utah State Capitol, a ginourmous building with a dome at the top along with many governmental buildings beside.
            A few blocks south you find Temple Square which is going through a renovation but it contains a lot of monuments and buildings often refered to as temples, one iconic building is the Tabernacle but one of my favorites is the Joeseph Smith Memorial 
            Building because of its castlelike exterior. Across from North Temple street you find the Conference center, which is a really big theather. A couple blocks down is mostly entertainment space containing spots like the City Creek Center which is a mall 
            that has outdoor and indoor sections. To the west of that you will find The Salt Palace Convention Center a space where major conventions come to the city. Yet again to the West of that is the Delta Center home of two pro sports teams the Utah Jazz of the NBA and 
            the Utah Hockey Club of the NHL. It also hosts concerts and other major events that come to Salt Lake City. Yet again to the west of that you have The Gateway which is a little different than a outlet mall but also contains multiple amenities like museums
            and arcades and even has a plaza in the middle of it. There are many hotels nearby that area since it will be a tourist attraction. Additionaly people could go into the streets and try the unique restaurants in Salt Lake City. Additionally this is outside of 
            SLC's city boundries but there's a small town called Park City about 40 minutes away from downtown SLC this place is useful for going skiing or snowboarding in the winter but make sure to bring your coats since it is very cold in there. 
            There are plenty of attractions such as the Aquarium outside of the city boundries but these small suburbs are still counted in the SLC Metro Area.
