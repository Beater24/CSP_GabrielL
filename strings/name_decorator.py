#Gabriel Lopez, Name Decorator on Python

print("Hello and Welcome to the Name Decorator. The purpose of this program is to give your name a little more light rather than just boring letters.")

name = input("What is your name?")

endzone = input("Please choose a symbol for your name")
startzone= input("Please choose the oppposing side of the symbol you chose (if there is no opposing side just choose the same one as last time)")

print(endzone,endzone,endzone,name,startzone,startzone,startzone)
