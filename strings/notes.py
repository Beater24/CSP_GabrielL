# Gabriel Lopez, Strings Notes on Python

#string is a data type that holds any info surrounded by quotation marks "" ''

name = input("What is your first name?\n").strip().capitalize()

print(f"Hello", name, "welcome to my house.")

#when we get syntax erroes it is because we didn't do things correctly.
